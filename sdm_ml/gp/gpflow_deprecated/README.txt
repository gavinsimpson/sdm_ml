Dear user,

in this directory, we provide code to fit both single-output and multi-output
GPs using GPFlow. This code is from an earlier iteration of the package and has
now been superseded by our own implementations. 

Note that the code was written for GPFlow v1, which makes it incompatible with
Tensorflow 2.0, which our new implementation relies on. If you wish to use the
code, please install Tensorflow v1.x and GPFlow v1.x.
